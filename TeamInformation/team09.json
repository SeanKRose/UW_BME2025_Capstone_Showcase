  "Project_Description": "Magnetic microrobots are soft micro-scale robots capable of travelling through tight junctions and vessels within the human body to deliver drugs at any location, using magnetic actuation for movement. One promising area of focus is kidney stone removal. While current treatments are invasive, prone to recurrence, and can result in harmful side effects, drug-loaded microrobots can dissolve kidney stones with minimal invasiveness. RENAL leverages computer vision, pathfinding, and 3D modelling to assist urologists with navigating microrobots within the renal system.",
