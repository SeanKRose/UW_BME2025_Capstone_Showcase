  "Project_Description": "Lung diseases are the second leading cause of hospitalization in Canada. A chest x-ray is currently the standard method of diagnosis for such conditions, but it is expensive, not portable, and exposes patients to harmful ionizing radiation. Despite being cheaper, highly portable, and transmitting zero radiation, ultrasound is underutilized mainly due to a lack of trained personnel. PneumoGuide provides an augmented reality solution to guide inexperienced ultrasound users towards correct probe placement for lung exams. ",
