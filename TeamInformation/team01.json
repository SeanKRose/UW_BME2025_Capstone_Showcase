  "Project_Description": "Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is an early indicator of dementia, yet traditional diagnostic methods are often inaccurate, expensive, and require clinical administration. Cognify was developed as an accessible, at-home cognitive monitoring tool for individuals under 65, integrating language, memory, and eye-tracking assessments through interactive digital tasks. By analyzing trends over time, Cognify provides users and healthcare providers with objective insights, enabling early health intervention. This approach bridges the gap between clinical assessments and everyday cognitive health monitoring, making early detection more practical, personalized, and proactive.",
