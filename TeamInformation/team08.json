  "Project_Description": "Misplaced ECG leads affect up to 64% of cases, leading to false diagnoses in 24% of patients. Our project aims to develop an AR-based training device that ensures accurate ECG electrode placement by referencing bony landmarks across diverse patient physiques. Using Unity and iOS, our mobile solution provides real-time feedback to trainees, enhancing learning efficiency and reducing variability in placement. By replacing traditional training with an interactive, standardized approach, we are addressing a critical gap in ECG education for healthcare professionals.",
