            <strong>About Me</strong> <br>
            My name is Sean Rose, and beside me is Zoe - my Golden Retriever. Welcome to my professional website. I created this website on my free time in order to show off some of my interests and skills, and as a platform to learn HTML & CSS.<br>
            My interests include learning about programming, digital & physical design, 3D printing and optimizing human experiences through social interactions and customer service. <br></brL><br>

            <strong> Education:</strong><br>
            I am currently in my 1B term of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Waterloo. Entering first year of University has its obvious challenges, especially with online learning due to the pandemic.
            However, I managed to maintain my high grades while completing this transition, in addition to becoming involed as a Rep for my Engineering Cohort.<br>

                I have been a Camp Director and an Integration Counsellor - working 1 on 1 with children with special needs.
