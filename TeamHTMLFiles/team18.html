            <body>Respiratory clinicians often face challenges when adjusting treatment plans for pediatric asthma patients due to several factors. Children may be uncooperative, and current methods for evaluating conditions are largely subjective. Smart Spacer seeks to address these challenges by engaging children in their own care and equipping clinicians with quantitative metrics on medication usage and breathing. With integrated sensors and an engaging, interactive platform, Smart Spacer combines real-time monitoring and data-driven insights to effectively support children, parents, and clinicians in managing pediatric asthma.</body>

        <h3 class="subtitle">Capstone Described in 3 Words:</h3>
        <p></p>

        <h3 class="subtitle">Favourite Capstone Memory</h3>
        <p>Last minute assembly the night before the symposium and the work sessions at a group member’s home when we couldn’t use the school wifi when building our software backend.</p>

        <h3 class="subtitle">Biggest Challenges</h3>
        
            <ol>
                
                <li>Juggling 4B with capstone consumed our lives at some points. Didn’t go to class or do any course work (which we do not recommend).</li>
                
                <li>We also did a lot of work over the 8 month co-op, so it was difficult to align our expectations/work completed with the ones the professors had. In a sense, it was slowing us down and I think we could have been much more productive in 4A if the deliverables actually fit to where we actually were in the process. We unfortunately didn’t really overcome this, we just kept doing what we were doing, just at a slower pace. At the end of the panel exam in 4A we figured that the professor didn’t remember that we were ahead of the game compared to the curriculum, so we spent a good chunk of time doing a disclaimer telling them that we already completed certain items during the 8 month co-op.</li>
                
            </ol>
        

        <h3 class="subtitle">Takeaways</h3>
        <p>Don’t scope too large! Our project was impressive in diversity, but the sheer amount of work (even after scoping down) was very burdening. Next time, it would be better if we just scoped down a little bit. </p>
        
        <h3 class="subtitle">Advice for Future BME Students</h3>
        <p>One team member took 1 day every other week to just do course work (bad look, don’t do it). While it is great to focus on capstone, don't let it consume your life. Also make sure you focus on other things like grad or work applications.</p>
