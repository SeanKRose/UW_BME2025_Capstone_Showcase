  "Project_Description": "Sound2Sleep addresses sleep disruption in children with epilepsy through an innovative closed-loop auditory stimulation device. With real-time detection of slow-wave brain oscillations, the technology delivers precise, phase-targeted bursts of pink noise to optimize the restorative properties of sleep. As a result, this intervention improves sleep quality and cognitive functioning in children with epilepsy. The take-home device offers families an accessible and non-invasive approach to managing sleep challenges, supporting children's daily performance and cognitive development.",
