We are developing a comfortable, continuous, cuffless blood pressure monitor that uses an optical sensor to estimate blood pressure in real time. Our AI-driven solution empowers patients to understand and manage their blood pressure while providing clinicians with personalized, actionable data to reduce the risk of subsequent strokes.",
