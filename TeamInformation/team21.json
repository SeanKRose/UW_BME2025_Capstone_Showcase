This innovative device detects high-risk seizure positions associated with SUDEP and wakes the user only when necessary, providing greater peace of mind and reducing anxiety. EEG recordings are stored in a mobile app, allowing users to securely share data with medical professionals for enhanced care and monitoring.",
