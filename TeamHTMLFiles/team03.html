            <body>Concussion underreporting remains a critical issue in hockey due to the absence of a fast, accurate evaluation method. NeuroShield is an innovative sideline device designed specifically for young adult hockey players that harnesses eye-tracking technology to quickly and reliably assess head impact symptoms after they occur. By employing infrared cameras, an LCD screen, and a dedicated phone app, NeuroShield conducts precise smooth pursuit and fixation tests on the fly. This enables sideline staff to be promptly alerted to head impact symptoms, effectively curbing underreporting.</body>

        <h3 class="subtitle">Capstone Described in 3 Words:</h3>
        <p>Memorable</p>

        <h3 class="subtitle">Favourite Capstone Memory</h3>
        <p>Working in the E5 computer lab to collect pupillary reflex and smooth pursuit videos with the Raspberry Pi.</p>

        <h3 class="subtitle">Biggest Challenges</h3>
        
            <p>The biggest challenge was getting the hardware, software, and app to work all-together before symposium. It was challenging to create a high-fidelity prototype in a limited amount of time. The hardware, software, and app had all been made separately and then had to be integrated together before symposium. It was difficult to book time on the laser cutter because it was often busy which setback our timeline because the team could not collect videos to test the software in a controlled lighting environment till the enclosure was built. Additionally, the software relied on two programed stimulusâ€™ which had to run one after the other and controlled through the app. Finally, the software had to be accurate in measuring pupillary reflex and accurate in mapping the pupil position. To overcome these challenges, we split up tasks among each team member and created small low-fidelity prototypes to test software and hardware parts of our prototype individually before the final prototype. We collected lots of data to improve the software accuracy and worked together as a team to troubleshoot parts of the prototype that did not work.</p>
        

        <h3 class="subtitle">Takeaways</h3>
        <p>The most important part of capstone we learned was to have clear design requirements and constraints. Our final idea for the prototype changed many times and our design requirements and constraints also changed. Having clear requirements and constraints presents clear guidelines and goals the device should achieve which helps all engineers on the team to design an optimal product.</p>
        
        <h3 class="subtitle">Advice for Future BME Students</h3>
        <p>Our advice to future students is start building your project early. There is very limited time during the capstone terms. Ordering parts, machining, and assembling takes lots of time so plan and test hardware early during the capstone process. Building low fidelity prototypes early will help with testing and brainstorming design improvements early to make a better product.</p>
