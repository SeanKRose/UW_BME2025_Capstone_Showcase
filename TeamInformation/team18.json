  "Project_Description": "Respiratory clinicians often face challenges when adjusting treatment plans for pediatric asthma patients due to several factors. Children may be uncooperative, and current methods for evaluating conditions are largely subjective. Smart Spacer seeks to address these challenges by engaging children in their own care and equipping clinicians with quantitative metrics on medication usage and breathing. With integrated sensors and an engaging, interactive platform, Smart Spacer combines real-time monitoring and data-driven insights to effectively support children, parents, and clinicians in managing pediatric asthma.",
