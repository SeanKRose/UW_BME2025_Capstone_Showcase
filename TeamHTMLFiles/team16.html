            <body>Peripheral intravenous (PIV) insertions are hospitals' most frequent invasive operation. However, PIV dislodgement is widespread, with failure rates of 35 - 50% and upwards of approximately 70%. PIVital aims to reduce PIV dislodgement rates in the forearm location and protect the PIV site. At the same time, it ensures that patients remain comfortable and that nurses can access and view the PIV site as needed. PIVital consists of a patch placed over the PIV site and a dome secured overtop to achieve this.</body>

        <ol>
            
            <li>Picking a topic: We had a hard time in 3B deciding on a final topic, we were all interested in different aspects of biomed and there were differences in interests for software vs. hardware. Through extensive research, discussions with Prof. Howcroft, and a lot of team meeting we came to an agreement.</li>
            
            <li>Sourcing materials: We had a lot of issues with obtaining materials like medical-grade silicone adhesive and silicon/acrylic sheets for the patch. With a lot of back and forth between multiple companies we were finally able to receive free samples from various companies but there were quite a few that ghosted us.</li>

        Be transparent with your group. If you are having issues with your part because of other courses then the best thing to do is to tell them so they can help you or come up with an alternate plan. Also, make sure each group member has a significant contribution they can talk about for the individual contributions and talk with the professor about it as needed
