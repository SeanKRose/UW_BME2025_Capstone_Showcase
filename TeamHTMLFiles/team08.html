            <body>Misplaced ECG leads affect up to 64% of cases, leading to false diagnoses in 24% of patients. Our project aims to develop an AR-based training device that ensures accurate ECG electrode placement by referencing bony landmarks across diverse patient physiques. Using Unity and iOS, our mobile solution provides real-time feedback to trainees, enhancing learning efficiency and reducing variability in placement. By replacing traditional training with an interactive, standardized approach, we are addressing a critical gap in ECG education for healthcare professionals.</body>

        <h3 class="subtitle">Capstone Described in 3 Words:</h3>
        <p>Suffering... with friends :)</p>

        <h3 class="subtitle">Favourite Capstone Memory</h3>
        <p>Despite all the suffering, it was done together! The camaraderie and companionship from all the groupmates was a constant reminder that as long as we worked together, it was going to be ok!</p>

        <h3 class="subtitle">Biggest Challenges</h3>
        
            <p>Four non software oriented people choosing to do an extremely software dependent project in Unity.</p>
        

        <h3 class="subtitle">Takeaways</h3>
        <p>This was the biggest project that all of us had ever attempted so itâ€™s fair to say that we made a lot of planning and logistical errors that we learned from. For example, making sure to choose an appropriate mixed reality/AR system at the start of 4A and not halfway through the first month of 4B :D </p>
        
        <h3 class="subtitle">Advice for Future BME Students</h3>
        <p>Find an advisor sooner rather than later (start looking in 3B!), get as much feedback as possible from anybody and everybody at every stage (even in just pure ideation!)</p>
