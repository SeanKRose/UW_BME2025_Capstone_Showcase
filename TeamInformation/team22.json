  "Project_Description": "Peritonitis is a common and painful infection for peritoneal dialysis patients. The present standard for early detection of peritonitis relies on visual detection of cloudy waste fluid, which can cause a delayed response to life-saving treatment. We have engineered a spectrometry-based approach to detect elevated levels of white blood cells in patientsâ€™ waste fluid, enhancing patient safety, reducing hospitalization costs, and improving the accuracy of early-warning alerts.",
