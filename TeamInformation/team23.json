  "Project_Description": "Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is an ultrasound-guided procedure for treating thyroid tumours. However, the current technique presents several real-time challenges for tracking the tumour due to patient movement and limited tissue contrast. RFAI seeks to enhance the RFA process by incorporating a machine learning model that outlines the residual tumour tissue in real-time. This innovation aims to simplify the procedure, improve patient outcomes, and encourage broader adoption among physicians, ultimately making this less invasive treatment more accessible to patients.",
