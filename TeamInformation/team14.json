  "Project_Description": "Current treatments for uveitis, like eye drops and injections, are ineffective and invasive, making disease management challenging, leading to poor adherence and inadequate control. The drug-eluting contact lens provides a non-invasive, sustained-release solution that delivers the medication directly to the eye over time. Our project ensures consistent drug levels, reducing the need for frequent dosing and improving patient compliance. By enhancing treatment effectiveness and convenience, our contact lens aims to prevent vision loss, reduce inflammation, and improve the quality of life for uveitis patients.",
