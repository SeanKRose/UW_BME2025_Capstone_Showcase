  "Project_Description": "Professional mouth painters push the limits of creativity, but their craft comes with intense physical challenges. Relying entirely on their neck and jaw for precision, they endure neck pain and fatigue, often exacerbated by traditional easels that fail to accommodate their needs. Our ergonomically designed easel changes that. With automated height, translation, and tilt adjustments, the voice-controlled easel minimizes discomfort while maximizing control. Seamlessly adapting to each artist empowers them to create without limitationsâ€”because nothing should stand between an artist and their vision.",
