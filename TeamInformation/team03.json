  "Project_Description": "Concussion underreporting remains a critical issue in hockey due to the absence of a fast, accurate evaluation method. NeuroShield is an innovative sideline device designed specifically for young adult hockey players that harnesses eye-tracking technology to quickly and reliably assess head impact symptoms after they occur. By employing infrared cameras, an LCD screen, and a dedicated phone app, NeuroShield conducts precise smooth pursuit and fixation tests on the fly. This enables sideline staff to be promptly alerted to head impact symptoms, effectively curbing underreporting.",
